# Introduction

## Title II {.center}

-   Refers to Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)

-   Applies to public entities like schools, colleges, and local and state governments

-   Prohibits the discrimination of a disabled individual by above public entities

-   Requires all individuals be able to benefit from and access their services

## Title II Examples {.center}

-   Accessible buildings

-   Online materials are accessible

-   Allowing service animals

## Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) {.center}

-   Department of Justice (DOJ) published a new rule in April 2024

-   Outlined accessibility regulations

-   Web content must meet WCAG Version 2.1, Level AA standards

# What I've Been Doing...

-   Researching and learning about the guidelines

-   Finding best practices

-   Breaking it down into digestible pieces

-   Creating content for the department

# Best Practices

## How does this apply to you? {.center}

Your content should be made accessible if:

::: incremental
-   You are distributing it to students

    -   Slides
    -   PDFs
    -   Lecture videos

-   It is a website for your class

-   It will be distributed on our department website for public use
:::

## Materials you do not need to check {.center}

-   Content provided by a book publisher

    -   Slides
    -   PDFs
    -   Lecture videos
    
-   Presumed accessible if they're distributed by a publisher

## Slide Accessibility {.center}

-   Less is more!

-   Main components to check:

    -   Alternative text
    -   Links
    -   Color contrast
    -   Overall formatting

## Slide Accessibility {.center}

-   In general, HTML based slides are best

    -   Quarto/Revealjs
    
-   Powerpoint is alright

    -   Allows you to add alternative text 

## Slide Accessibility {.center}

Annotating

-   Annotations made in class are unfortunately not accessible

-   Alt-text should be added only if slides are to be distributed

    -   You can still do annotations in class!
    
## PDF Accessibility {.center}

-   Trickier to do

-   Adobe is currently the only option

-   Has automatic accessibility checker

-   Can add alt-text

## In general... {.center}

-   Make materials accessible within reason

-   "Big items" to check

    ::: incremental
    -   Alternative text
    -   Keyboard checks
    -   Color contrast
    :::

## Other areas to pay attention to {.center}

-   Links

    -   Make sure links are descriptive

-   Avoid slang or abbreviations that may be difficult to understand

-   Not skipping header levels (HTML)

## Other areas to pay attention to {.center}

-   Font size/spacing

-   Emojis are OK, but:

    -   Ensure you're using emojis, not emoticons
        -   Emoji: üòÅ
        -   Emoticon: :)
    -   Use sparingly

# Resources

## Canvas

-   Canvas should now automatically check material accessibility

    -   Works for uploaded files

    -   Not insanely reliant, but gives a good estimate

-   YuJa 

    -   For lecture recordings, automtatically provides closed captioning

## Automatic Website Checkers {.center}

-   IBM Accessibility Checker extension

    -   False positive rate is high
    -   But, gives a good idea of areas that could be improved
    
-   WAVE Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool

    -   Checks websites for accessibility
