## Up until now... {.center}

-   We have been working with proportions
    -   We use proportions for **categorical (qualitative) data**
-   What if our data is qualitative (numerical)?

Examples: Height, weight, time, measurement of length

# Distributions

Recall: Describing a distribution

## Shape {.center}

Symmetric, mound-shaped, skewed? How many ”peaks”?

## Center {.center}

Where does the center of the pattern appear?

-   Generally refers to mean or mode

## Variability {.center}

How spread out is the distribution?

-   Generally described in terms of [**standard deviation**]{.underline}
-   Variability will be a big topic in this class!

## Unusual Data {.center}

-   Outliers
-   Outliers can affect results- so we need to be aware of them.

## Example Data Distribution {.center}

## What's the difference? {.center}

::: {.column width="50%"}
-   This is data from a study

-   Then, we plot it

-   Here a histogram is used

    -   Could use other vices: dot plot, box plot, etc.

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Each data point represents one simulation of our study

-   The more simulations the better!

-   Generally, this is best plotted using a histogram or dot plot.

## Summary Statistics {.center}

Sometimes it is helpful to summarize quantitative data with numerical values

## Mean {.center}

Add up all the values and divide by the total number of values

## Median

Half of the data is above the middle, half of the data is below the middle.

-   "Middle" is found when the data is ordered from lowest to highest

## Outliers

Unusual data points

-   Easy to pick out using visualizations

-   Can be found if the data is ordered too

    -   "Eyeballing" it

## Mean and Median Example {.center}

<br>
Suppose we observe the following data:

|     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|  8  | 10  | 11  | 12  | 15  |  7  |  8  |  9  |

<br>

-   Mean: **10**

-   Median: **9.5**

# Type I and Type II Errors

## Time for a detour... {.center}

Recall our hypotheses

-   $H_{0}$: What's expected to happen; chance explanation

-   $H_{A}$: Wait, something different happened!

## Time for a detour... {.center}

We want strength of evidence in favor of the alternative
