## Recall... {.center}

-   [**Population:**]{.underline} The complete collection of **all** objects that are of interest for a given scenario

    -   Ex: People, animals, basketball games- can be anything, really!

-   [**Sample:**]{.underline} A subset of observational units from the population of interest

## Recall... {.center}

-   Goal: Generaliztion

    -   Describe the sample

    -   Extend to a larger population

# Sampling

## Representative Sample {.center}

A sample that is similar to or representative of a larger population.

-   Ex: Would our class data be representative of all UNL students?

## Bias {.center}

A sample that consistently underestimates or overestimates a population parameter of interest

-   Ex: Would the UNL volleyball team be representative of the average height of all female UNL students?

## Visual of Population vs. Sample

## How should we sample? {.center}

## Convenience Sampling ❌ {.center}

-   Not a good method

-   "Hand picking" a sample

-   Creates bias

-   Ex: Interested in all Nebraska adults but only taking a sample of those living in Lincoln.

## Simple Random Sampling ✅ {.center}

-   Every population member has an equal chance to be chosen

-   Can generalize our results to entire population

-   Choose from a sampling frame

-   [**Sampling frame:**]{.underline} a list of all individuals in a population of interest

    -   Ex: List of all students from UNL registrar

## More Symbols! {.center}

In some situations, we are interested in the **long run average**

-   As opposed to the **long run proportion**, in the last chapter

## More Symbols! {.center}

-   Sample mean: $\bar{x}$
-   Sample Standard Deviation: $s$
-   Population Mean: $\mu$
-   Population Standard Deviation: $\sigma$

## Symbol Comparison {.center}

<br> Symbols we use depend on our variable type:

|                |                          |                           |
|----------------|:------------------------:|:-------------------------:|
|                | **Categorical Variable** | **Quantitative Variable** |
| **Population** |          $\pi$           |           $\mu$           |
| **Sample**     |        $\hat{p}$         |         $\bar{x}$         |

. . .

<br>

Note: We only use sample standard deviation and standard deviation symbols ($s$, $\sigma$) when we are dealing with **quantitative variables.**
