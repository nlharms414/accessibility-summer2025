## Simulation

So far, we've used a simulation-based approach to gather strength of evidence.

-   Effective
-   Relatively easy

But...

-   Can be tedious
-   Not always practical in real life
-   Enter: Theory!

## The Theory-Based Approach {.center}

-   Used when computers weren't a thing
-   Allows prediction of the null distribution shape (aka, pattern)
-   Gives us p-values and standardized statistics
-   Should get the same or similar results as simulation

## The Null Distribution (in depth!) {.center}

-   Sometimes, data follows a known distribution
-   Commonly, we assume data follows the **normal distribution**
-   The **normal distribution** is one of many known patterns that data can follow
-   In this class, we always assume the null distribution is normally distributed

## The Null Distribution (in depth!) {.center}

Since we know the null distribution is normally distributed, we know the following:

-   Bell shaped
-   Centered at $\pi$
-   Can predict standard deviation
    -   Without the Applet!

## Example Null Distribution

## Why does sample size matter? {.center}

If sample size is too small:

-   Theory-based approach will not be accurate
-   Curve might not be bell-shaped

Theory-based "rule of thumb":

-   Need at least 10 successes and 10 failures

## To illustrate...

:::
:::::

-   Both are centered at 0.50
-   Left graph n = 30
-   Right graph n = 300

## Central Limit Theorem

-   "Backbone" of statistics

Definition:

-   If the sample size (n) is large enough, the distribution of the sample proportions will be bell-shaped (approximately normal), centered at the long run probability ($\pi$), with a standard deviation:

$$standard\: deviation\: of\: the\: null=\sqrt{\frac{\pi(1-\pi)}{n}}$$

## Using Theory for Standardized Values {.center}

Replace S.D. with theory-based calculation

$$z=\frac{Observed\: Statistic - Hypothesized\: Value}{Standard\: Deviation\: under\: the\: null}$$

$$=\frac{\hat{p}-\pi}{\sqrt{\frac{\pi(1-\pi)}{n}}}$$

## Using the Applet

We can still use the One Proportion Applet for the theory-based approach

-   Check "Normal Approximation" box
-   Applet fits a normal curve to the data

In more advanced classes, we use calculus to get these values.

## Using the Applet

-   Observed statistic & symbol:

-   Hypotheses (in symbols):

Do we meet the criteria for the theory-based approach?

| Scenario: |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Researchers investigated whether children might be as tempted by toys as by candy for Halloween treats. Test households offered two plates to children: one with candy and one with a small toy. They observed the selections of 283 children that night and found that 148 of the kids chose candy. |

## Halloween Treats

-   Sample & size: [**n = 283 kids**]{.fragment}

-   Variable of interest: [**Chose candy or not**]{.fragment}

-   Parameter & symbol: [$\pi$ **= long run proportion of kids that chose candy**]{.fragment}

-   Observed statistic & symbol: [$\hat{p} = \frac{148}{283}$]{.fragment}

-   Hypotheses (in symbols):

    -   [$H_{0}$**:** $\pi$ **= 0.5**]{.fragment}
    -   [$H_{A}$**:** $\pi$ **â‰  0.5**]{.fragment}

Do we meet the criteria for the theory-based approach? [**Yes! More than 10 failures & successes.**]{.fragment}

## Halloween Treats {.center}

Standard deviation using theory:

$$standard\: deviation\: of\: the\: null=\sqrt{\frac{\pi(1-\pi)}{n}}$$

$$=\sqrt{\frac{0.5(1-0.5)}{283}}=0.0297$$

## Halloween Treats {.center}

Then, we use the calculated standard deviation to obtain the standardized statistic:

$$standardized\: statistic\: =\frac{0.523-0.5}{0.0297}=0.774$$

## Halloween Treats {.center}

Now we find the standardized statistic with the simulation approach:

$$standardized\: statistic\: =\frac{0.523-0.5}{0.02}=0.793$$

Notice, we get nearly the same number!

## Halloween Treats Conclusion {.center}

Since our standardized statistic using either approach is not outside the twos, we conclude the following: <br><br> *"We do not have enough evidence to conclude that the long-run proportion of kids who choose candy differs from 0.5."*
