    -   Not accessibility related, but noticed a "nubmers" typo in section 31.3.1 :)
    -   Could perhaps implement a way to skip over the page navigation if so desired (skip to content)
    -   Cannot visibly tell when you're on a code chunk to copy it for some reason

## 7/16

-   Meeting today
    -   Got started on making slides for 218
    -   Current slides are in revealjs format, but toyed with the idea of creating beamer slides as well? (for people who prefer pdf)
        -   Could also just print html slides to pdf
    -   make note of alt text, show in html coding of the page

## To-do...

-   Create templates for 218
-   Learn up on LaTeX in slides
-   Beamer (pdf/pptx) slide outputs?

## Resources and such

-   [Mine-Cetinkaya](https://mine-cr.com/about/)
-   [Understanding Techniques for WCAG Success Criteria](https://www.w3.org/TR/2014/NOTE-UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20-20140916/understanding-techniques.html#understanding-techniques)

## Other thoughts...

-   Perhaps create a website with finished materials?
    -   Like slide templates
-   Easy to follow "guidelines" for department use

## Orientation Presentation

Outline: 

-   Intro: what is Title II? Give high level overview of the main standards that need compliance.
-   What I've been working on
-   Best practices
    -   Ways to check accessibility/resources 
    -   Less is more
    -   Color schemes
    -   Closed captioning
    -   Canvas should now give an overview
        -   Not 100% reliable but gives a good estimate
    -   No "checker" is 100% reliable
    -   Manual keyboard checks are good.
    -   Links
    -   For PDFs, Adobe has a built in accessibility checker.
-   Probably need to include a bunch of examples of things
